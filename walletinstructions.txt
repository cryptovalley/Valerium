To mine Valerium:
Go to Help>Debug Window>Console> enter this command and hit Enter key....     setgenerate true -1
The -1 corresponds to the number of processor cores you want to use to mine the coin. -1 uses 1 core, -2 uses 2 cores,
-3 uses 3 cores, etc.

You can now close the Console window. The wallet will continue to solo mine the coin until the wallet app is closed.
